# Hakeam
#### A project aimed for the society

## Problem Statement
* Current conditions for acceptor- donor matching are not cross-referencing intentions of donors willing to donate their kidneys to someone close to them.
* Cadaver donors who are willing to donate do not find suitable acceptors in time for being helpful to the acceptor. The locations must be taken into account.
* In the event of failure of ambulance arrival, nearby nurses can be informed of their need immediately and can cater to the needs of the diseased in time. 

## Objective of Hakeam
* To create a central platform for kidney donation where, acceptors are dynamically matched with the donor. Including cross-referencing of intentions.
* To enable the real time sharing of a patientâ€™s location with a hospital to provide the hospital destination without the phone call.
* To bring all nurses and doctors to provide home visits in time slots its feasible for them.

## Tools used
* DJANGO(1.11)
* PYTHON
* JQUERY
* GOOGLE API
* JAVASCRIPT

## Future Scope
* To enable a dynamic matching in the entire transplant list, i.e as soon as a acceptor with a higher priority comes, he is immediately matched with a potential donor. (liver, pancreas and heart-transplant)
* To send real time information of a patient to a hospital and send an ambulance/nurse based on the same. 
* To  improve the accuracy of our compatibility predictions.

## To run
* Clone the repository
* Change directory to 'mysite'
* Install libraries using 'pip install'
* Run the server using 'python manage.py runserver'
